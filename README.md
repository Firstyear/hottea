Hot Tea ðŸ«–
===========

What could be better than processing large volumes of data while enjoying a hot cup of tea? That's
exactly what this library is for, using OpenCL and Rust to help process data while you can relax
with a cuppa.

This library is still in development, and probably not ready for you to experiment with.

## Code of Conduct

See our [code of conduct]

## Goal

To expose a set of common/useful stats functions in a way that can be consumed from Rust
or R programs, that take advantage of modern CPU and GPU hardware acceleration features.
This includes SIMD and OpenCL.

## Issues

Please open an issue or PR and I'd be happy to help.
